## Overview

This is a basic HTML and CSS project. It is a responsive layout. I have designed this for two devices, Mobile and Desktop, with the breakpoint at 940px. The Desktop layout is a horizontal layout whereas the Mobile layout is vertical.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

- Look at the design and formulate a plan and workflow for the project.
- Write the HTML.
- Write CSS for mobile.
- Write CSS for Desktop.
- Find an optimal breakpoint, for the media query to fire.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to break a project into mutiple small parts and then work on them one by one, keeping the final outcome in mind. I also learned how to plan my work and distribute my time evenly for the project.

### Continued development

I'd be further looking towards polishing my skills and understanding of CSS. Also I'd like to focus on Flexbox and Grid layouts in the future projects.
